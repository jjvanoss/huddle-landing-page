  <h3>Flowing Conversations</h3>

  You wouldn't paginate a conversation in real life, so why do it online? Our threads
  have just-in-time loading for a more natural flow.

 <h3>Your Users</h3>

  It takes no time at all to integrate Huddle with your app's authentication solution.
  This means, once signed in to your app, your users can start chatting immediately.
